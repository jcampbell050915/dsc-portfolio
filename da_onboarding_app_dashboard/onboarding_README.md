## Day 1 Onboarding
### Businesss Problem
Organization had over 20 pages worth of onboarding content to get started on Day 1. It was a difficult process to navigate even with a facilitaor, and it typically took over 4 hours to complete computer setup. Once a digital adoption solution was created, the team wanted to track the progress, validate time to complete, and determine next steps.
### Solution
A dashboard was created to visualize the state of the Day 1 Onboarding application on QlikSense. To preprocess the information, a python script was created to merge and export tasks on process funnel exports.
